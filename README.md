July 4th Holiday Closure Popup Snippet
This repository contains a reusable HTML/CSS/JavaScript code snippet (popup-injection-code.html) for displaying a one-time popup alert announcing a Fourth of July business closure. It’s designed to be easily injected into an existing website without requiring a full page rewrite.

📄 File: popup-injection-code.html

The code is meant to be copy-pasted into your existing site’s index.html file.
